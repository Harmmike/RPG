To add/remove/modify items/locations/monsters/traders, you will need to modify the .xml files within the Release\GameData folder.

When you modify one of these files, you MUST follow the conventions used.
  -This includes enclosing all the 'nodes' with brackets <>
    - For example <Weapon MaximumDamage="999" MinimumDamage="998" Price="999" Name="Cliff's Member" ID="1009"/>
    - If you don't do this, it will cause an error and the item will not be in the game, and could crash the client (I did not add try/catch for null values).
  - The ID MUST be unique.
    - Regardless of the name, if the ID is not unique it will just override the first item with that same ID and the first will not be in the game.
  - Locations and Monsters need images, else it will cause an error and could crash the client (Again, I did not add a catch for this.)
    - I will not paint for you.
    - The image files should be put in the respective folder.
    - The image name must match the .xml file's 'ImageName="xxx".
    - The image files should be .png.
    - Locations with monsters/traders/quests, should follow the same conventions with a child node. (Just follow the examples already in place, should be apparent)
    - ALL locations need an x,y coordinate, and the x,y coordinate MUST be unique and MUST be adjacent to another location. (guess what happens if not)
  - LootItems are the items a monster can drop when killed.
  - Percentage is the % chance for that item to appear/drop. This is true regardless of the implementation.(Could be a monster spawn, a LootItem, or even a quest)
  - Quests should be straightforward.
  - Recipes have ingredients and output items, output is the result of the combined ingredients.
