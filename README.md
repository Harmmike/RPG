Test RPG C#

To play the game, you'll need to download and extract the Release.zip file.
Once you do that, just run the WPFUI.exe and the game should load up.  You may get a prompt because running random executables from random people isn't smart. I do promise it's not a virus.

You can use WASD to move North/West/South/East.
You can use Z to attack. (if a weapon is selected and a monster is present)
You can use C to eat a consumable. (if a consumable is selected)
You can use I to open the iventory tab.
You can use Q to open the quest tab.
You can use R to open the Recipes tab.
